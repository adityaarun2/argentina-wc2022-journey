                Heading into the 2022 World Cup, Argentina carried with them a rich tapestry of football history, colored by triumphs, near-misses, and the indelible legacy of past legends. With two World Cup titles to their name, won in 1978 and 1986, Argentina has long been a beacon of football excellence on the global stage. The shadow of Diego Maradona, one of football's greatest icons, has loomed large over the team, especially his legendary performance in Mexico's 1986 World Cup, which has been a source of inspiration and a high benchmark for subsequent Argentine squads.
